    Created the git repository for Project 1, following Professor Salazar's instructions. This project is multi-component. Tjere are tjree parts of this project, the first being a logger program, followed by an encryption program, and finishing with a driver program. The intention of this multicomponent program is for understanding basic operating system concepts through the use of initialization, user commands, logging, and termination. This project will be written in python for easy use.
