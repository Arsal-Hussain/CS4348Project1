    Created the git repository for Project 1, following Professor Salazar's instructions. This project is multi-component. Tjere are tjree parts of this project, the first being a logger program, followed by an encryption program, and finishing with a driver program. The intention of this multicomponent program is for understanding basic operating system concepts through the use of initialization, user commands, logging, and termination. This project will be written in python for easy use.

    Starting first session of Project 1. Initial plan is to add the original files from project beginning stage (cpu and main memory) to repository, then begin with logger program.

    Upon further discovery, it appears the cpu.py and mem.py files listed in the project instructions are not necessary. Logger.py, Driver.py, and Encrypt.py files have been created.

    Started and potentially completed logger file. Instructions were straightforward for the use of logger, as it will continue working until the instruction line reads "QUIT" in which case it will end logging the message. Instructions also indicated the use of year-month-day format along with the 24 hour clock implemented, which will show before every logging message. The line will begin as the timestamp from the datetime module, the action requested, and the message.
